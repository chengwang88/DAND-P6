## Data Explore and Scratch

The 2008 flight data set is explored in R. 
Two directions are explored. One is the flight cancellation.
The number of flight cancellation for each month is explored. 
The overall flights for each month are close but not exactly the same.
Considering the different number of days in each month and relative small number of flight cancellation,
the cancellation rate is calculated and uses as a metric to represent the cancellation for each month.
The reason of flight cancellation is also explored and cancellation rate for each reason is also calculated for each month.

Months in winter have high cancellation rate as well as the cancellation rate caused by extreme weather.
September also has high cancellation rate caused by extreme weather.
So the total number of cancellation for each day is also checked. In September, there are 3 days with over 1000 cancellation and 
it is caused by hurricane Ike after I checked the weather history.

Another is the flight delay time.
The average flight delay time is calculated over the hour of the day. 
It will be shown as bar plot with hour as x-axis and average delay time as y-axis.
